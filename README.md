##Password_Generator

#Description: This site is a modified version of a starter code given for instructional purposes.The starter code consisted of 3 files: html, css, and javascript. The html and css files were already completed. Then javascript was added in order to fulfill the purpose. That being, after clicking on the “Generate Password” button, a prompt will appear, asking the user for a length(between 8 and 128 characters), their preference on lower/upper case,. Special characters and numbers. After the user completes prompts a randomly generated password will appear on the screen within user specifications.

#Additional Features:
	-Some additional features include a catch, in case the user inputs a length that is less than 8 and greater than 128 characters. In addition, if the user does not activate any criteria, an alert will be activated, allowing the user to repick their criteria.
	-A border was added to the hover ability on the “Generate Password” button, essentially giving it a ‘highlighted’ view.
